  <documentation>Facility Medical Equipment Maintenance enables the customer to populate the Actual, Projected, Budget or Benchmark equipment maintenance metrics for a facility, location, organization or department or any combination within that hierarchy for the reporting period.  These equipment maintenance metrics include incident investigations of reported device failures, acceptance testing of medical equipment, planned work orders to maintain equipment and corrective work orders to repair equipment not working properly. </documentation>

  <element name="PlanningCategoryCode" type="code">
    <documentation>These IDS's can be used to capture Actuals, Budgeted, Projected or Benchmarks for any metric for the reporting period. A single IDS can be for only one Planning Category/Subcategory combination. If the customer reports this at the departmental level, then each IDS represents one Department/Category/Subcategory combination. The customer can generate these at multiple levels if they so choose. IDS's at the facility level, or IDS's down to the departmental level, or anything and everything in between. The distinction between Budgeted (near-term) and Projected (longer term) is generally accepted, but how the customer uses these categories is up to them; they just enable a means of making comparisons. Actuals would capture the real statistics for the reporting period. If they are so inclined, they might generate "Benchmark" IDS's if say there is an industry formula for a hospital or department of their size. Multiple benchmark IDS's might be generated for different percentiles, if they exist or are calculable which is probably at the beginning of the fiscal year, or when industry benchmarks are issued.</documentation>
