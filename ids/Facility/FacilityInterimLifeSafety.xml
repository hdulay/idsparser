  <documentation>Interim Life Safety Measures (ILSM) are health and safety measures that are put in place to protect the safety of patients, visitors, and hospital staff during construction in healthcare facilities.  This could include fire protection systems (i.e. smoke detectors, sprinker system, fire suppression, fire extinguishers, fire alarm systems), smoke barriers, emergency evacuation plans, exit paths, etc., that could contribute to the well being and safety of occupants in the healthcare facility.  Construction has an impact on the life safety systems in a healthcare facility so interim plans are devised to address the hazards created by the construction work activity.  Facility Interim Life Safety enables the customer to populate the Actual, Projected, Budget or Benchmark ILSM metrics for a facility, location, organization or department or any combination within that hierarchy for the reporting period.</documentation>

    <documentation>These IDS's can be used to capture Actuals, Budgeted, Projected or Benchmarks for any metric for the reporting period. A single IDS can be for only one Planning Category/Subcategory combination. If the customer reports this at the departmental level, then each IDS represents one Department/Category/Subcategory combination. The customer can generate these at multiple levels if they so choose. IDS's at the facility level, or IDS's down to the departmental level, or anything and everything in between. The distinction between Budgeted (near-term) and Projected (longer term) is generally accepted, but how the customer uses these categories is up to them; they just enable a means of making comparisons. Actuals would capture the real statistics for the reporting period. If they are so inclined, they might generate "Benchmark" IDS's if say there is an industry formula for a hospital or department of their size. Multiple benchmark IDS's might be generated for different percentiles, if they exist or are calculable which is probably at the beginning of the fiscal year, or when industry benchmarks are issued.</documentation>

    <documentation>FireDetectionSuppressionImpairmentPermits is a group of attributes pertaining to tracking permits issued for disabling a fire protection system, alarm or detection device. Fire protection systems include smoke detectors, sprinker systems, fire suppression, fire extinguishers and fire alarm systems. An impairment of any of these fire protection systems occurs when that protection system, alarm or detection device is removed from service. During construction, it may become necessary to disable a system, alarm or device. Fire Protection Impairment permits are requested and must be approved prior to disabling the system.</documentation>
