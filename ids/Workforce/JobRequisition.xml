 	Job Requisition enables the customer to populate the Actual, Projected, Budget or Benchmark 
	statistics for a job request by facility, organization or cost center for a reporting period.  
	It tracks when the job request was opened, filled or cancelled.  It also captures the number of days the 
	request was open and if it was filled internally or outside of the company.

		An Organizational Unit is a specific group or entity for organizing or managing

		in specified objectives.  These may be Departments, Divisions, Nursing Units, Service Lines, Regions,
		 Cost Centers, etc.  A G/L Cost Center is a segment of an enterprise for which Accounting is performed 
		in the General Ledger.  G/L Cost Centers are arranged into a hierarchy which allows roll-ups and 
		drill-downs on financial information within the enterprise.  Low-level Cost Centers may be 
		Nursing Units if the hierarchy is based on physical location, or may be Service Specialty 
		if the hierarchy is based on Service Line.  Use this attribute to link to the Cost Center 
		associated with this job request.

		<documentation>
		These IDS's can be used to capture Actuals, Budgeted, Projected or Benchmarks for 
		any metric for the reporting period. A single IDS can be for only one Planning 			
		Category/Subcategory combination. If the customer reports this at the facility level, 
		then each IDS represents one Facility/Category/Subcategory combination. The customer can 
		generate these at multiple levels if they so choose. IDS's at the facility level, or IDS's 
		down to the cost center level, or anything and everything in between. 

		The distinction between Budgeted (near-term) and Projected (longer term) is generally accepted, 
		but how the customer uses these categories is up to them; they just enable a means of making 
		comparisons. Actuals would capture the real statistics for the reporting period.

		If they are so inclined, they might generate "Benchmark" IDS's if say there is an industry formula 
		for a hospital or organization of their size. Multiple benchmark IDS's might be generated for 
		different percentiles, if they exist or are calculable which is probably at the beginning of the 
		fiscal year, or when industry benchmarks are issued.

		IMPORTANT:  Identifies the actual Job linked to this instance.  There currently is no IDS to

		get to a job using path Worker/Jobs/Job with its assigned SourceName and SourceInstanceId.    
		IF WANT a generic Job reference outside of Worker, could use same approach as did with 
		Survey (inline data type of "Survey" that is only used within another IDS like PatientSatisfaction).  
		This is the approach used here...
