	Hours Worked enables the customer to populate the Actual, Projected, Budget or Benchmark 
	statistics on a set of reported hours assigned to a worker on a particular job by 		
	facility, organization or cost center for a reporting period. It tracks both
	working (e.g. regular, overtime, etc.) and non-working (e.g. sick, vacation, personal, etc.) 
	hours and the cost per hour.

		These IDS's can be used to capture Actuals, Budgeted, Projected or Benchmarks for 
		any metric for the reporting period. A single IDS can be for only one Planning 			
		Category/Subcategory combination. If the customer reports this at the facility level, 
		then each IDS represents one Facility/Category/Subcategory combination. The customer can 
		generate these at multiple levels if they so choose. IDS's at the facility level, or IDS's 
		down to the cost center level, or anything and everything in between. 

		The distinction between Budgeted (near-term) and Projected (longer term) is generally accepted, 
		but how the customer uses these categories is up to them; they just enable a means of making 
		comparisons. Actuals would capture the real statistics for the reporting period.

		If they are so inclined, they might generate "Benchmark" IDS's if say there is an industry formula 
		for a hospital or organization of their size. Multiple benchmark IDS's might be generated for 
		different percentiles, if they exist or are calculable which is probably at the beginning of the 
		fiscal year, or when industry benchmarks are issued.
