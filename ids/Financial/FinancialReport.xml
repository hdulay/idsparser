	 Financial reporting offers many ways to capture accounting information for a healthcare 
	entity for a specific period of time.  This includes information on revenues, expense costs,
	assets, liabilities, equities, gains and losses.  Additionally, it includes planning 
	information such as projected, budget, actual and benchmarking statistics.

		An Organizational Unit is a specific group or entity for organizing or managing resources 
		within the enterprise.  Usually, these are made up of people or locations which cooperate 
		in specified objectives.  These may be Departments, Divisions, Nursing Units, Service Lines, 
		Regions, Cost Centers, etc.  A G/L Cost Center is a segment of an enterprise for which Accounting 
		is performed in the General Ledger.  G/L Cost Centers are arranged into a  hierarchy which allows 
		roll-ups and drill-downs on financial information within the enterprise.  Low-level Cost Centers 
		may be Nursing Units if the hierarchy is based on physical location, or may be Service Specialty 
		if the hierarchy is based on Service Line.

		These IDS's can be used to capture Actuals, Budgeted, Projected or Benchmarks 
		for any metric. A single IDS can be for only one Category/Subcategory combination. 
		If they report this at the departmental level, then each IDS represents one 
		Department/Category/Subcategory combination. The customer can generate these 
		at multiple levels if they so choose. IDS's at the facility level, or IDS's 
		down to the departmental level, or anything and everything in between. 
		As long as they are consistent, roll-ups and drill downs in the 
		marts will work properly. 
		
		For instance, FinancialReport IDS's are probably created as quarterlies. So at the beginning 
		of a fiscal year, the client might generate "Budgeted" FinancialReport IDS's for
		each of the four upcoming fiscal quarters. They might generate "Projected" 
		FinancialReport IDS's for out year quarters. The distinction between Budgeted 
		(near-term) and Projected (longer term) is generally accepted, 
		but how the customer uses these categories is up to them; they just 
		enable a means of making comparisons. 
	
		If they are so inclined, they might generate "Benchmark" FinancialReport IDS's 
		if say there is an industry formula for a hospital or department of their size. 
		Multiple benchmark IDS's might be generated for different percentiles, 
		if they exist or are calculable. Probably at the beginning of the fiscal year,
		or when industry benchmarks are issued.

		As they close each financial quarter, they will generate the "Actual" FinancialReport IDS.
		In BI, they will be able to compare the actual performance to budget, benchmark or whatever. 
		It is not even necessary that all actuals have corresponding budgeted, projected or benchmarks.
		
		For Receivables, these IDS's might be generated monthly or at whatever interval they choose. 
		The principal of the Planning Category and Sub Category remains the same. 
		The number of IDS's generated depends on the granularity in reporting they are looking for.
