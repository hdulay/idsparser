	<notes>
	- Changed name of subject to TransferEvent to differentiate it as a type of clinicalEvent.
	- For FacilityLocation, tweaked the definition slightly
	- EventDateTime and FacilityLocation are common fields, but are implemented separately here to distinguish their usage/description in this Event.
	- Changed field order, and removed Transfer descriptor in front of the data elements (redundant).
	- Tweaked TypeCode definition
	- Tweaked MethodCode definition
