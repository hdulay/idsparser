	Discharge is a type of clinical event capturing data specific to when the patient is discharged from the facility.  An encounter should only have a discharge record if an admission record exists and the patient has actually been discharged.  If the patient is being discharged to a facility outside of the system, can also capture the name of the facility and record the facility location type.  If the patient had been moved to a facility within the system, a Transfer event would have been generated instead of a Discharge record.
