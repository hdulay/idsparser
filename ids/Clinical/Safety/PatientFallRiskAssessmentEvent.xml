 	Patient Fall Event is a type of clinical event tracking information regarding the patient falling.  
	It includes contributing factors and reason patient fell, level of injury sustained, likelihood of patient 
	falling again, assessment of a patient's prior fall, if any, and steps taken to lower the patient's risk of falling.

		<documentation>
		A Survey consists of a collection of questions, each question can have answers, and there 
		is a scoring mechanism for the answers and for the collection as a whole.  For Patient Fall Risk Assessment, 
		it captures details on a specific assessment protocol that determines the patient's fall risk probability. 
		Assessment protocols utilize a predefined set of risk factors and points assigned based on question 
		responses calculating the patient's overall fall risk score.

		<documentation>
		Responses to survey questions are evaluated and assigned points from which the overall score is determined. 
		Sentiment analysis uses this score to determine whether the patient fall risk is High risk, Low risk, etc.  
		For example, the Morse Fall Risk protocol allows for a score ranging from 0 to 125.  
		A patient can be "No risk", "Low risk" if score is between 0 and 24, "Moderate risk" if between 25 and 44, 
		or "High risk" if scored 45 or higher.

		OtherFallRiskFactors is a collection of FallRiskFactor records containing additional data that is 
		outside of the assessment protocol used during the fall risk assessment of this patient. 
		A risk factor is something that increases risk or susceptibility.  The fall risk factor 
		(e.g. Gait, Dizziness, Vision, Medicated, etc.) is based on the patient's current state and 
		then assigned a score indicating risk of falling.
